# Air Travel Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive dashboard encapsulating over 18 million flight records, targeting industry stakeholders to derive actionable insights.
- **Tool Usage:** Leveraged SQL for data querying and transformations, ensuring optimal performance for large datasets.
- **Scope:** Explored facets of the aviation sector, unraveling patterns related to carrier performance, airport efficiency, and flight punctuality.

## Code Environment
- **Power BI:** 2.120.731.0
- **SQL Server:** SQL Server 2019

## Data Cleaning and Features Extraction
- Integrated vast data records ensuring data coherence and consistency for precise visual analytics.
- Segregated and processed flight-specific features like origin, destination, departure, and arrival times, flight durations, delays, cancellations, and their respective reasons.

## Dashboard Building
Devised a multi-view dashboard consisting of distinct segments: Key Performance Indicators, Carrier Performance, Airport Traffic Analysis, and Delay Metrics.
- Formulated a plethora of performance metrics like total flights, average delays, cancellations, and unique carriers, providing a quick snapshot for rapid decision-making.
- Investigated performance by carriers, emphasizing cancellation reasons and delay durations.

## Productionization
The final dashboard was hosted on a Power BI cloud service, ensuring easy access and seamless interaction for end-users and stakeholders.

## Insights & Recommendations
- **Carriers:** Identified top-performing carriers based on punctuality, efficiency, and cancellation rates.
- **Airport Traffic:** Visualized major travel hubs based on incoming and outgoing flight traffic, aiding in congestion management strategies.
- **Delays:** Isolated prominent reasons for flight delays, providing carriers with data-backed feedback to improve punctuality.
- **Seasons:** Derived insights about high and low travel seasons, aiding airlines in optimizing their flight schedules.
- **Infrastructure:** Advised a data warehouse solution for efficiently managing and updating this vast trove of flight data, ensuring real-time insights and analysis.
